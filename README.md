To edit CSS, you'll need to install [sass](https://sass-lang.com/install) (command line) first. After you've made your changes to the SCSS files, you need to compile them using the following command in the root directory:

`$ sass css`

Alternatively, you can also watch changes to the SCSS files using the following command:

`$ sass --watch css`

It will compile the SCSS files everytime you save. Very easy and efficient for live testing.
